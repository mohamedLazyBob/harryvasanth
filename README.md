# About me ðŸ¦¾

Hi there, I'm [@HarryVasanth](https://github.com/harryvasanth). I'm a System Administrator at [@01-edu](https://github.com/01-edu/) on the Infrastructure team, where I deploy, automate and manage servers, services and everything in between. I love automation and optimization and have a passion for finding ways to make processes more efficient.

In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies and tools or diving into the latest research in my field. In case something is itching you, I am open to feedback; drop me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harryvasanth).

Oh look, you are on [dark mode](https://github.com/settings/appearance#gh-dark-mode-only)[light mode](https://github.com/settings/appearance#gh-light-mode-only).
